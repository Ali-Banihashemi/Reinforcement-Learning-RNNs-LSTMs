# Advanced AI Techniques: Reinforcement Learning, RNNs, LSTMs, and Search Algorithms

This repository contains projects demonstrating advanced artificial intelligence techniques, including reinforcement learning, deep Q learning, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM), and various search algorithms. These projects highlight my expertise in applying these methods to solve complex problems using Python and Google Colab.

This was done for the AI course in 2024 at the University of Tehran under the instruction of Professor Khoshnevisan.
